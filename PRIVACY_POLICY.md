# Privacy Policy for Microsoft To Do Exporter

**Effective date:** February 12, 2026

**Microsoft To Do Exporter** (`ms-todo-export`) helps you export your Microsoft To Do data. This Privacy Policy explains what data the service accesses, how it is used, and the choices you have.

## Data Collection and Usage

- **Account access (with consent):** To export data, `ms-todo-export` requires your explicit authorization to access your Microsoft account (OAuth via Microsoft Graph). We only request the permissions necessary to read your To Do tasks and related metadata.
- **Exported data:** With your consent we access and export your tasks, lists, notes, due dates, and completion status. Exports are created on-demand and provided to you for download.
- **Authentication tokens:** Access tokens are used to call Microsoft APIs. Tokens are not stored persistently and are discarded after the export process completes.
- **Logs & diagnostics:** Minimal logs may be retained for troubleshooting and security; logs do not include full task contents.

## Data Sharing

- **Third parties:** We do not sell or share your personal data. We interact with Microsoft services (Microsoft Graph) to retrieve your To Do data as part of the export — that interaction is governed by Microsoft's terms and policies.

## Data Retention

- Export files, tokens, and any temporary data are kept only as long as necessary to complete the export, then deleted.

## User Controls

- You can revoke the app's access via your Microsoft account's app permissions page at any time.

## Changes to This Policy

- We may update this policy; changes will be posted here with an updated effective date.
